# Ray Tracing

My implementation of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book/tutorial. <br>
Its not 100% done, however. <br>

## Rendered Ray Traced Images
Here are some ray traced images I've rendered so far.<br>

![Demo ray traced image](screenshots/diffuse-no-shadow-acne.png) <br>
Diffuse spheres.

![Demo ray traced image](screenshots/multiple-samples.png) <br>
Multi-sampled (randomly) pixels, with normals colored.

![Demo ray traced image](screenshots/red-sphere-on-blue-gradient-bg.png) <br>
Simple ray-sphere intersection.

![Demo ray traced image](screenshots/two-spheres.png) <br>
No multi-sampling, thus jagged edges should be visible.
